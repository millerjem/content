title: 'Use Konvoy Projects to Maintain Boundaries Between Resources'

description: |-
    An Konvoy project is a namespace with additional annotations and is the central vehicle
    by which access to resources is managed for regular users. Use Konvoy projects
    to maintain boundaries between resources.

rationale: |-
    A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other
    communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators, or if allowed to create projects,
    automatically have access only to their own projects.

    To display a list of projects configured on a system, run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get projects</pre>

    Verify each project represents a unique community.

# Since this is operational guidance and not a configuration check,
# a CCE should not be assigned.
