title: 'Enable seccomp'

description: |-
    Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make,
    allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in
    the Konvoy Container Platform. 

    By default Konvoy is delivered with seccomp disabled, allowing all workloads to run
    unconfined and issue all system calls.

    To configure seccomp profiles, follow the instructions in the Konvoy Cluster
    Administration documentation:

rationale: |-
    Failure to enable seccomp will allow containers to issue any and all system calls
    available in the environment.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'they are not'

ocil: |-
    Verify that Security Context Constraints (SCCs) have been configured with seccomp:
    <pre>$ oc get scc -ocustom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,SECCOMP-PROFILES:.seccompProfiles</pre>

# Since this is operational guidance and not a configuration check,
# a CCE should not be assigned.
