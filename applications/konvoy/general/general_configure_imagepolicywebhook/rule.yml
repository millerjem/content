title: 'Manage Image Provenance Using ImagePolicyWebhook Adminission'

description: |-
    Konvoy administrators can control which images can be imported, tagged, and run in a cluster.
    There are two facilities for this purpose: (1) Allowed Registries, allowing administrators to
    restrict image origins to known external registries; and (2) ImagePolicy Admission plug-in which lets
    administrators specify specific images which are allowed to run on the Konvoy cluster.

    Configure Image Provenance using the <tt>ImagePolicyWebhook</tt> admission controller per
    the Image Policy chapter in the Cluster Administration documentation:

rationale: |-
    Image Policy ensures that only approved container images are allowed to be ran on the Konvoy platform.

    <pre>$ grep admissionConfig /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</pre>
