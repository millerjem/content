title: 'Configure the etcd Certificate Authority for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure etcd is configured to make use of TLS encryption for client
    connections, follow the Konvoy documentation and setup the TLS
    connection between the API Server and etcd. Then, verify
{{%- if product == "konvoy5" %}}
    that <tt>etcd</tt> has the <tt>ca</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>
      --etcd-cafile=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt</pre>
{{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Konvoy deployments
    for persistent storage of all REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This
    requires the API Server to identify itself to the etcd server using
    a SSL Certificate Authority file.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
{{%- if product == "konvoy5" %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A3 etcd /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>
      --etcd-cafile=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt</pre>
{{%- endif %}}
