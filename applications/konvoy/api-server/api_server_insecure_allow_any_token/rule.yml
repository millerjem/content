title: 'Disable Insecure Tokens'

description: |-
    This check is only applicable on Konvoy 3.10 and earlier deployments.
    Insecure tokens should be forbidden. Edit the API server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s) and
    remove any instance of the <tt>insecure-allow-any-token</tt> parameter.

rationale: |-
    Accepting insecure tokens would allow any token without performing
    actual authentication. User information is parsed from the token and
    connections are allowed.

severity: medium

references:
    cis: 1.1.3

ocil_clause: 'Konvoy 3.10 or earlier is installed and insecure-allow-any-token is configured and enabled on the master node'

ocil: |-
    If Konvoy 3.10 or earlier is installed, run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep insecure-allow-any-token /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</pre>
    The output should return no output.
