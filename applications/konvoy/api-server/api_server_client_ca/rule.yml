title: 'Configure the Client Certificate Authority for the API Server'

description: |-
    Certificates must be provided to fully setup TLS client certificate
    authentication. To ensure the API Server utilizes its own TLS certificates, the
    <tt>clientCA</tt> must be configured. Verify
    that <tt>servingInfo</tt> has the <tt>clientCA</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
{{%- if product == "konvoy5" %}}
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>
      --client-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    </pre>
{{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    API Server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain
    encrypted in transit. Configure the API Server to serve only HTTPS traffic.
    If <tt>-clientCA</tt> is set, any request presenting a client
    certificate signed by one of the authorities in the <tt>client-ca-file</tt>
    is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the <i>CommonName</i> of
    the client certificate.

    Run the following command on the master node(s):
{{%- if product == "konvoy5" %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep ca /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>clientCA: ca.crt</pre>
{{%- endif %}}
